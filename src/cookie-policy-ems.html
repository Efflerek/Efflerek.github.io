            dates are set in the cookies themselves; some may expire after a few minutes while others may expire after
            multiple years. Cookies placed by the website you’re visiting are called “first party cookies”.</p>
        <p>Strictly Necessary cookies are necessary for our website to function and cannot be switched off in our
            systems. They are essential in order to enable you to navigate around the website and use its features. If
            you remove or disable these cookies, we cannot guarantee that you will be able to use our website.</p>
        <p>We use the following types of cookies in our website:</p>
        <h2>Essential Cookies</h2>
        <p>We use essential cookies to make our website work. These cookies are strictly necessary to enable core
            functionality such as security, network management, your cookie preferences and accessibility. Without them
            you wouldn't be able to use basic services. You may disable these by changing your browser settings, but
            this may affect how the Websites function.</p>
        <h2>Performance and Functionality Cookies</h2>
        <p>These cookies are used to enhance the performance and functionality of our website but are non-essential to
            their use. However, without these cookies, certain functionality like videos may become unavailable or you
            would be required to enter your login details every time you visit the website as we would not be able to
            remember that you had logged in previously.</p>
        <h2>Marketing Cookies</h2>
        <p>These account-based marketing cookies enable us to identify future prospects and personalize sales and
            marketing interactions with them.</p>
        <h2>Analytics and Customization Cookies</h2>
        <p>These cookies collect information that is used to help us understand how our website is being used or how
            effective our marketing campaigns are, or to help us customize our website for you.</p>
        <p>We use cookies served by Google Analytics to collect limited data directly from end-user browsers to enable
            us to better understand your use of our website. Further information on how Google collects and uses this
            data can be found at: https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/. You can opt-out of all Google
            supported analytics on our Websites by visiting: https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout.</p>
        <h2>Social Media Cookies</h2>
        <p>These cookies are used when you share information using a social media sharing button or “like” button on our
            Site or you link your account or engage with our content on or through a social networking website such as
            Facebook, Twitter or Google+. The social network will record that you have done this. These cookies may also
            include certain code that has been placed on the platform to help track conversions from ads, optimize ads
            based on collected data, build targeted audiences for future ads, and remarket to qualified users who have
            already taken certain action on the platform.</p>
        <h2>Third Party Cookies</h2>

            originally set them.</p>

                <h4>History of EMS training</h4>
                <p>Electrical Muscle Stimulation (EMS) has emerged as a revolutionary training technique, redefining
                    the
                    way we approach physical fitness. This article traces the historical development of EMS-based
                    training, exploring its origins, milestones, and transformation into a modern fitness
                    phenomenon.

                <p>EMS training is not a one-size-fits-all solution, but it does offer tangible benefits when used
                    appropriately. It's a tool that can amplify muscle activation, enhance time efficiency, and
                    contribute to strength gains and endurance improvement. Check out for more why ems is so
