        <p>The website is provided to you "AS IS" and "AS AVAILABLE" and with all faults and defects without warranty of
            any kind. To the maximum extent permitted under applicable law, EasyMotionSkin, on its own behalf and on

            or other harmful components.</p>
        <p>Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of or limitations on implied warranties or the limitations on
            the applicable statutory rights of a consumer, so some or all of the above exclusions and limitations may
            not apply to you.</p>

        <h2>Limitation of Liability</h2>
        <p>Notwithstanding any damages that you might incur, the entire liability of EasyMotionSkin and any of its
            suppliers under any provision of this Agreement and your exclusive remedy for all of the foregoing shall be
            limited to the amount actually paid by you for the website.</p>
        <p>To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, in no event shall EasyMotionSkin or its suppliers be
            liable for any special, incidental, indirect, or consequential damages whatsoever (including, but not
            limited to, damages for loss of profits, for loss of data or other information, for business interruption,
            for personal injury, for loss of privacy arising out of or in any way related to the use of or inability to
            use the website, third-party software and/or third-party hardware used with the website, or otherwise in
            connection with any provision of this Agreement), even if EasyMotionSkin or any supplier has been advised of
            the possibility of such damages and even if the remedy fails of its essential purpose.</p>
        <p>Some states/jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so
            the above limitation or exclusion may not apply to you.</p>

        <h2>Severability</h2>
        <p>If any provision of this Agreement is held to be unenforceable or invalid, such provision will be changed and
            interpreted to accomplish the objectives of such provision to the greatest extent possible under applicable
            law and the remaining provisions will continue in full force and effect.</p>
        <p>This Agreement, together with the Privacy Policy and any other legal notices published by EasyMotionSkin on
            the Services, shall constitute the entire agreement between you and EasyMotionSkin concerning the Services.
            If any provision of this Agreement is deemed invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, the invalidity of
            such provision shall not affect the validity of the remaining provisions of this Agreement, which shall
            remain in full force and effect. No waiver of any term of this Agreement shall be deemed a further or
            continuing waiver of such term or any other term, and EasyMotionSkin's failure to assert any right or
            provision under this Agreement shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. YOU AND
            EasyMotionSkin AGREE THAT ANY CAUSE OF ACTION ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THE SERVICES MUST COMMENCE WITHIN
            ONE (1) YEAR AFTER THE CAUSE OF ACTION ACCRUES. OTHERWISE, SUCH CAUSE OF ACTION IS PERMANENTLY BARRED.</p>

        <h2>Waiver</h2>
        <p>Except as provided herein, the failure to exercise a right or to require performance of an obligation under
            this Agreement shall not effect a party's ability to exercise such right or require such performance at any
            time thereafter nor shall be the waiver of a breach constitute waiver of any subsequent breach.</p>
        <p>o failure to exercise, and no delay in exercising, on the part of either party, any right or any power under
            this Agreement shall operate as a waiver of that right or power. Nor shall any single or partial exercise of
            any right or power under this Agreement preclude further exercise of that or any other right granted herein.
            In the event of a conflict between this Agreement and any applicable purchase or other terms, the terms of
            this Agreement shall govern.</p>

        <h2>Amendments to this Agreement</h2>
        <p>EasyMotionSkin reserves the right, at its sole discretion, to modify or replace this Agreement at any time.
            If a revision is material we will provide at least 30 days' notice prior to any new terms taking effect.
