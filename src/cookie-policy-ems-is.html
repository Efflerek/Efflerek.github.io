            choices for how to control them.</p>

        <h2>What is a cookie?</h2>

        <h2>Why do we use cookies?</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>To facilitate the operation and functionality of our website;</li>
            <li>To improve your experience of our website and make navigating around them quicker and easier;</li>

        <h2>What type of cookies does EasyMotionSkin use?</h2>
        <p>Cookies can either be session cookies or persistent cookies. A session cookie expires automatically when you
            close your browser. A persistent cookie will remain until it expires or you delete your cookies. Expiration
            dates are set in the cookies themselves; some may expire after a few minutes while others may expire after
            multiple years. Cookies placed by the website you’re visiting are called “first party cookies”.</p>
        <p>Strictly Necessary cookies are necessary for our website to function and cannot be switched off in our
            systems. They are essential in order to enable you to navigate around the website and use its features. If
            you remove or disable these cookies, we cannot guarantee that you will be able to use our website.</p>
        <p>We use the following types of cookies in our website:</p>
        <h2>Essential Cookies</h2>
        <p>We use essential cookies to make our website work. These cookies are strictly necessary to enable core
            functionality such as security, network management, your cookie preferences and accessibility. Without them
            you wouldn't be able to use basic services. You may disable these by changing your browser settings, but
            this may affect how the Websites function.</p>
        <h2>Performance and Functionality Cookies</h2>
        <p>These cookies are used to enhance the performance and functionality of our website but are non-essential to
            their use. However, without these cookies, certain functionality like videos may become unavailable or you
            would be required to enter your login details every time you visit the website as we would not be able to
            remember that you had logged in previously.</p>
        <h2>Marketing Cookies</h2>
        <p>These account-based marketing cookies enable us to identify future prospects and personalize sales and
            marketing interactions with them.</p>
        <h2>Analytics and Customization Cookies</h2>
        <p>These cookies collect information that is used to help us understand how our website is being used or how
            effective our marketing campaigns are, or to help us customize our website for you.</p>
        <p>We use cookies served by Google Analytics to collect limited data directly from end-user browsers to enable
            us to better understand your use of our website. Further information on how Google collects and uses this
            data can be found at: https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/. You can opt-out of all Google
            supported analytics on our Websites by visiting: https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout.</p>
        <h2>Social Media Cookies</h2>
        <p>These cookies are used when you share information using a social media sharing button or “like” button on our
            Site or you link your account or engage with our content on or through a social networking website such as
            Facebook, Twitter or Google+. The social network will record that you have done this. These cookies may also
            include certain code that has been placed on the platform to help track conversions from ads, optimize ads
            based on collected data, build targeted audiences for future ads, and remarket to qualified users who have
            already taken certain action on the platform.</p>
        <h2>Third Party Cookies</h2>
        <p>Some cookies that have been set on our website are not set on a first party basis by EasyMotionSkin. The
            Websites can be embedded with content from third parties to serve advertising. These third party service
            providers may set their own cookies on your web browser. Third party service providers control many of the
            performance and functionality, advertising, marketing and analytics cookies described above. We do not
            control the use of these third party cookies as cookies can only be accessed by the third party that
            originally set them.</p>
        <h2>How you can manage cookies?</h2>
        <p>Most browsers allow you to control cookies through their 'settings' preferences. However, if you limit the
            ability of websites to set cookies, you may worsen your overall user experience, since it will no longer be
            personalized to you. It may also stop you from saving customized settings like login information. Browser
            manufacturers provide help pages relating to cookie management in their products.</p>
        <p>Browser manufacturers provide help pages relating to cookie management in their products. Please see below

            saved information (e.g. saved login details, site preferences) if you block cookies on your browser.
            Different browsers make different controls available to you. Disabling a cookie or category of cookie does
            not delete the cookie from your browser, you will need to do this yourself from within your browser, you
            should visit your browser's help menu for more information.</p>
